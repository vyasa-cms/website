Vyasa's REST API lives under \`/api/v1\`. Sign in with a session cookie (\`POST /api/v1/auth/login\`) or send an API key as \`Authorization: Bearer <key>\`. Who may call each route is listed in [route access](/docs/reference/route-access).

The pages in this section are generated from \`admin/openapi.json\`, which the server also serves at \`/api/openapi.json\` and \`/api/docs\` (Swagger UI) on every install.
